        "Since the MLB season is in full swing, I've decided that I want to answer a long time question of mine about the game of baseball through statistics. What are the greatest factors when determining the number of runs that will be scored in a game of baseball? To solve this problem I want to look at many possible components. These include:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Weather\n",
        "    1. Wind speed\n",
        "    2. Temperature\n",
        "  2. Pitching\n",
        "    1. Earned Run Average (ERA)\n",
        "      - This is the average number of runs a pitcher gives up for every 9 innings pitched.\n",
        "  3. Batting\n",
        "    1. On Base Percentage (OBP)\n",
        "      - This is the percentage that a player gets on base for each at bat, for an entire team.\n",
        "\n",
        "I will collect data on these topics and explore how they contribute to the number of runs scored in a given baseball game. I will find which factors contribute the most and build a model accordingly. Lastly, I can test this model against statistics from other games and compare how accurate my model turned out to be.\n",

        "1. Earned Run Average was the only data point that had a significant effect on the number of runs scored.\n",
